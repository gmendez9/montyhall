\description{
\itemize{
\item The Game Host Opens a Goat Door, a door with a Goat behind it.
}
}
\details{
The host will always open a door with a goat behind it. But it canâ€™t be a door the contestant has already selected. So it must be a door that is not a car and not a current contestant selection.Note that if the contestant selects the car on the first guess the host can open either door, but if the contestant selects a goat the host only has one option.
